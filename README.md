# Portfolio

#### Welcome To My Webpage **August 2018**

#### _By Mark Mangahas_

## Description

Create a portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS, which will later act as the landing page for your programming portfolio. Do not use a template to create your initial HTML and Bootstrap. Begin your work with an empty page and an initial empty commit.

Your CSS stylesheet must be named styles.css and reside in a css directory. Your HTML file page must be called index.html.

Your webpage should include the following content:

Your name.
An image of you, or something that represents you.
A list of projects you have created with active links to their GitHub pages sites or GitHub repositories.
For each, include a brief description of the project and what languages it uses.
An “About Me” section.
Your background (education, job experience, or why did you decide to take a class on programming, etc).
Your current interests/hobbies/skills.
Create a gh-pages branch so that your site can be viewed on GitHub Pages at your-username.github.io/portfolio (for example).
Don't forget your Git commits with an initial commit and a commit for every major code change, and include a README in your GitHub repository!
